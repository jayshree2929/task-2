# SQL Internship - Task 2

## ðŸ“Œ Topic: Data Insertion and Handling NULLs

This task focuses on using **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** commands in SQL to insert, update, and delete records, as well as handle `NULL` values in real-world scenarios.

---

## âœ… What I Did

1. Used the existing database `LibraryDB` (created in Task 1).
2. Inserted sample data into:
   - `Author`
   - `Book`
   - `Student`
   - `Loan`
   - `Librarian`
3. Handled missing values using `NULL` where applicable.
4. Updated existing records (like changing phone numbers and decreasing book stock).
5. Deleted records using `DELETE` with a `WHERE` clause.
6. Inserted partial data (e.g., a student with only a name).
7. Demonstrated checking for missing data using `IS NULL`.
